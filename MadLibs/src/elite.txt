
 It was about 3 42 ago when I came to the hospital in a 42.
 The hospital is a/an 4 place, there are a lot of 24 2 here.
 There are nurses who have 34 24. 
 If someone wants to come into my room I told them that they have to 24 first.
 I have decorated my room with 23.
 Today a doctor came into my room and they were wearing a 42 on their 4.
 I heard that all doctors 234 23 every day for breakfast.
 The most 423 thing about being in the hospital is the 4 234.
